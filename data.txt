He's making us things from it all the time and we love the food.  Directions are simple, easy to read and interpret, and fun to make.  We all love different kinds of cuisine and Raichlen provides recipes from everywhere along the barbecue trail as he calls it. Get it and just open a page.  Have at it.  You'll love the food and it has provided us with an insight into the culture that produced it. It's all about broadening horizons.

It feels very solid and the pneumatic tires give it great maneuverability and handling over bumps.  The control arm is solid metal, not a cable, which gives you precise control and will last a long time.  The settings take some experimentation with your various products to get it right, but that is true of any spreader.  It has good distribution... probably flings material a little farther on the right side than the left, but it is far more even than my crappy Edgeguard ever was.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice spreader", "unixReviewTime": 1354492800, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2012", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

As the previous reviewer pointed out, it leaks badly and just pops off. There is no way to fix or tighten this junction and when the plastic wears a bit the hose just falls off and sprinkler is useless.AVOID ANY GILMOUR Sprinklers with this spike base. The sprinkler heads themselves work fairly well.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Terrible spike base", "unixReviewTime": 1218585600, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2008", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}
